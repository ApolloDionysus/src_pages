# The Bible
Greatest story I have ever heard. It is hard to have faith. But I respect my parents who are vary religious.
And find it very curious that the people most militantly against Jesus's teachings go to yoga, attend seminars, etc
trying to learn how to live. When that is what the Bible tells us more than anything. He who does not believe but follows the Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven? Something like that. I should
probably write that one down

# The Silmarillion
stories full of tragedy, that feel very human.

# The Fall of Google
friend said it was good
